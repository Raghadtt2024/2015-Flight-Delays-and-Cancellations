# Flight Delays and Cancellations

Flying has become a necessary element of our lives in the modern world. On the other hand, flight cancellations and delays can ruin our plans and make us frustrated. Collaborated on an innovative data analysis and visualization project to shed light on this problem. Using this dataset will led to examine the Delays and Cancellation. Moreover, deep diving into the data yielded insightful information about airline dependability, airport traffic patterns, aircraft types, types of delays, flight cancellations, and the impact of time on flight operations.

## Codes and Resources Used

- Editor Used: Google Colaboratory
- Python Version: 3.10.12
## Python Packages Used
 
- Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`.
- Data Visualization: `seaborn`, `matplotlib`.
## Source Data
The Flight Delays and Cancellations Dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays). For the analysis, I have downloaded the Flights.csv file.
## Results and evaluation
By analyzing the Flight Delays and Cancellations Dataset, I discovered the following:
- Valuable insights into the causes and consequences of flight disruptions
- Weather emerges as the primary reason for cancellations.
- Air traffic restrictions represent the least prevalent cause of cancellations reasons.
- Airlines can make well-informed judgments to deploy resources more efficiently by looking at historical data on cancellations and delays.
- January and March emerge as the primary months experiencing significant delays. Conversely, July exhibits the lowest occurrence of delays.
